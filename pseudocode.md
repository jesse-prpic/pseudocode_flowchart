# Pseudocode
- Plain language description of the steps in an algorithm or a program
- Bridge between the program's logic and the actual code

## Importance
- Helps to understand and plan the program logic, so its easier to code.
- Improves collaborations in team projects
- Helps with troubleshooting
- Identify the core areas of the programming that needs to be done

## Characteristics
- Plain language: Simple and understandable
- Structured: Follows a proper logic sequence
- Abstracted: Focuses on logic more than the syntax
- Detailed: Thorough walkthrough that helps explain the logic

## Basic constructs:

- Sequential 
```
Step 1: Do this
Step 2: Do that
```

- Conditional
```
IF condition THEN
    Do something

ELSE
    Do something else

END IF
```

- Loops
```
    WHILE condition meets
        Do something
    END WHILE (have certain exit statements)
```

```
    FOR EACH item in collection
        Do something
    END FOR
```

## Practical Examples

- Example 1: Calculating the sum of a list of numbers
```
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    Initialise the sum to 0
    FOR each number in the list
        ADD the number to sum
    END FOR
    Print sum
```

- Example 2: Finding the maximum number in a lsit
```
    Initialise max to the first number of the list
    FOR each number in the list
        IF number is > greater than max THEN
            set max to number
```
